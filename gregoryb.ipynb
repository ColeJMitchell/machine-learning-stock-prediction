Fortunately, the api uses a ListingGenerator which allows us to access our metered connection in sequential blocks. The following example shows how we can utilize this behavior, grabbing blocks of 100 posts at a time. In our example, we'll grab blocks of posts until we reach 5000 posts or our access times out. Notice that the procedure ends early with around 750-800 posts collected. The results are sparce, because our connection either timed out or was metered down by reddit. The latter option is more likely."
